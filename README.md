# Barcode_Detection
I have developed a barcode detection system using the Faster RCNN object detection algorithm.
This work would not have been possible without the contributions of RockyXu66. Their work on Faster RCNN for Open Images Dataset Keras provided a valuable foundation for this project. I would like to thank them for their generosity in sharing their code and for their helpful feedback.

The code for Faster RCNN for Open Images Dataset Keras is available at https://github.com/RockyXu66/Faster_RCNN_for_Open_Images_Dataset_Keras.

# Report
I have included a report in this repository that provides a detailed overview of the Faster RCNN algorithm. This report will help you to understand the algorithm.

# Dataset
The dataset is publicly available on Kaggle and can be accessed at the following URL: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ansariehteeshamaqeel/book-barcode-detection.
The Book Barcode Detection Dataset on Kaggle is a meticulously curated collection of high-quality images, exclusively showcasing book barcodes. This dataset serves as a reliable foundation for training and evaluating barcode detection models, enabling researchers and developers to benchmark and advance their algorithms. By focusing specifically on book barcodes, we aim to provide a specialized resource tailored to the needs of professionals working in book-related domains.
